The SnippetPx module enhances the snippet experience in PowerShell by offering
a new format for Snippets: plain, ordinary ps1 files. These snippets are not
just blocks of script that could be injected into a file. They are also
invocable! This enables better reuse of commonly used pieces of script that
would not otherwise be placed into a PowerShell function, either because the
function support in PowerShell won't allow for it to be invoked properly in
the current scope, or because it isn't big enough to warrant adding another
function to the function pool.
